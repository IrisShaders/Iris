# Iris 1.2.6 Changelog (trimmed)

Iris 1.2.6 is now available for download, fixing minor bugs and adding support for 1.19.1.

We hope for this to be one of the last big bugfix releases before PBR (Iris 1.3.0). When we release PBR, we plan to drop support for 1.17.1, meaning that the Iris release supporting PBR will only support 1.16.5, 1.18.2, and potentially 1.19 if Mojang releases it by then. We hope this makes sense, because actively supporting 4 different Minecraft versions would just be too much with our current development team.

This release was developed by coderbot, IMS, and Pepper.
