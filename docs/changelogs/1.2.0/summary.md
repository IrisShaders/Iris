Iris 1.2.0 is here for Minecraft 1.16.5 / 1.17.1 / 1.18.1, bringing the long awaited Shader Configuration GUI! This release was jointly developed by coderbot, IMS, and FoundationGames, but also contains code contributions from Justsnoopy30 and maximum#8760.

The shader configuration system and GUI was a massive undertaking, with development of this iteration beginning in June 2021 with development of the previous iteration (as seen in Starline) having started in February 2021. Applying option changes while accounting for all the complexity and edge cases but also keeping shader pack loading extremely fast took a ton of work. An intuitive and functional GUI on top of that was also a ton of work.

But finally, it is ready for release! We've included some smaller issue fixes as well.

Here's what's changed since 1.1.5:

💻 A new shader configuration system built from the ground up for performance and compatibility
⛰️ Support for Optifine's prepare pass
🗒️ Support for the renderStage and blendFunc uniforms, to allow SEUS PTGI HRR 3 to load
🗣️ Multiple translations have been updated
🩹 ...as well as many other fixes!

Known potential issues:

❌ SEUS PTGI HRR Test 3 currently has major graphical issues (SEUS PTGI HRR 2.1 is compatible).
