Iris version 1.1.4 for Minecraft 1.16.5, Minecraft 1.17.1, and Minecraft 1.18.1 has been released!

This release was jointly developed by coderbot and IMS, and also contains a number of contributions from maximum#8760 and Justsnoopy30. It also contains many other smaller (but still important) contributions from many other people!

This release mainly focuses on bug fixes, and closes over 50 GitHub issues! It resolves a huge number of bugs, and the Iris experience with supported packs should be substantially improved as a result.

In other news, shader configuration is also in the final testing & bug fixing phases, meaning that very soon, official Iris releases will support modifying shaders through a GUI without the need for any 3rd-party forks or workarounds. Stay tuned for more updates on that!
