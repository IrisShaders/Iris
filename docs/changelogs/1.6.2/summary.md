# Iris 1.6.2 Changelog (trimmed)

Iris 1.6.2 has released for 1.18.2, 1.19.2, and 1.19.4, improving performance, enhancing debug mode, and fixing many bugs such as broken maps and text.

Note: Due to changes in Sodium 0.4.11, all objects will be mipmapped. With current technology, this is not fixable, and some objects (notably sugar cane) will look different than usual.
