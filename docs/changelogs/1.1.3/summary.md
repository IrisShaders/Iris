Here's what's changed since 1.1.2:

- :sodium: Sodium is no longer bundled, and must be installed separately (The installer still installs it for you)

- 🖐 Hands now have proper shadows / lighting with most shader packs
- 🧙‍♀️Witches and drowned now have proper lighting with Complementary Shaders
- 🌌 Night sky effects now render properly with Complementary Shaders (galaxies if manually enabled, auroras) and AstraLex (planets)
- 💡 If manually enabled, Scene-Aware Colored Lighting now works properly on Complementary Shaders, even on macOS!
- 🌈 Rainbows and rain puddles now appear when using Complementary Shaders
- 🗣 A number of translations have been updated and tweaked
- 🩹 Patched a number of other minor bugs, crashes, and issues

Known potential issues:

- ⚠ Sodium 0.4.0-alpha5 for 1.18 is still in early alpha, meaning that you might run into significant bugs or other issues. Please exercise good issue-reporting skills if you want to report issues with the 1.18 versions of Iris / Sodium.
- ⬆ Remember to update to [Immersive Portals 0.33](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod/files/3543328) if you are using Immersive Portals on 1.17.1
- ⬆ If you are using Indium on 1.17.1+, you must update it to version 1.0.1 or later. Indium 1.0.0 is not compatible with Sodium 0.3.3.
