# Iris 1.6 Changelog (trimmed)

Iris 1.6 has released for 1.18.2, 1.19.2, and 1.19.4.

This release adds **many** new features for shader developers, close to being one of the biggest releases ever of Iris.
These features allow for things never done before with shaders.

We have been working with many shader developers on exclusive features for this version, and they will be announced as they release. Packs such as Shrimple (https://modrinth.com/shader/shrimple) are already taking full advantage of what Iris 1.6 offers.
