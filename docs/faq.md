# FAQ

> Q. How do I disable my shaders?

A. Press K to disable shaders without using the GUI.

> Q. I added Iris, why is my game crashing?

A. There are a few possible reasons:

• You're using an outdated version of Indium, Sodium Extras or Better Sodium Menu.

• You're using an unsupported shader pack.

• You're using macOS, which has limited support.

• You may have an incompatible mod installed.

> Q. What shaders have been tested and are working with Iris?

A. See [this](./supportedshaders.md) document for the list

> Q. Will (insert feature) part of OptiFine be added to iris?

A. Iris is specifically a shaders mod. Other features are not planned for Iris. However, many other wonderful mods have been made by the fabric modding community which cover many of the features of OptiFine.
