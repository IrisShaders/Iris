# What is Iris?

Iris is a Minecraft mod built using the modern and elegant [Fabric Modloader](http://fabricmc.net) that aims to bring full support for [OptiFine](https://optifine.net) shaderpacks to Fabric. It will be compatible with [CaffeineMC](https://github.com/CaffeineMC) optimization mods such as Sodium in the near future, which will allow Iris to render breathtaking graphics while maintaining a low performance overhead.

Iris is completely free and open source, and you are free to read, distribute, and modify the code as long as you abide by the (fairly reasonable) terms of the [GNU LGPLv3 license](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/master/LICENSE). This should be a quite nice change of pace from the closed-source nature of OptiFine. For the most part, Iris started as a pet project, a way to have fun and get more experience in rendering. However, we at IrisShaders are also frustrated by the constant incompatibilities and issues that players have reported when using OptiFine, amd especially OpriFabric. By developing a compatible and open source shaders mod, we hope to work towards a community where players and developers no longer have to worry about OptiFine and it's incompatibilities.

## Where can I get Iris?

The team behind Iris plans to have full releases published on CurseForge for Minecraft Fabric 1.16.X and 1.17.X by June 8th, 2021. Until then, alpha versions are available from [GitHub](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/releases) and the latest sources can be downloaded above. However, please note that Iris alpha releases and sources are unstable and highly incomplete. If you are not a developer or familiar with compiling and running Minecraft mods from source, OptiFine or OptiFabric is likely the better choice until after the full release.

That being said... **If you want to test out the newest features of the mod, please consider becoming a [Patron](https://www.patreon.com/coderbot), which will give you access to compiled alpha builds**. Alternatively, developers who know what they are doing can compile the mod themselves using the sources mentioned above.

## I'm having trouble with Iris. Where can I get help/support?

The [Iris Discord server](https://discord.gg/jQJnav2jPu) is home to a passionate community of mod developers and shader enthusiasts, many of whom would be more than willing to assist you with any mod trouble. **Please ask on Discord** before submitting an issue on GitHub, many problems are easily solved with a bit of troubleshooting, and you will likely get a much faster reply on Discord than on GitHub. In addition, the discord is a great place to chat about the mod and follow development.

## Iris Goals

First and foremost, Iris intends to be a *correct* and *compatible* shaders mod, and these two things come before everything else, including speed. Not to say that there won't be optimizations, because those are certainly planned: they're just a lower priority. However, especially in the early stages of the project, we are entirely willing to sacrifice a few frames here and there in order to have a robust implementation reasonably free of bugs.

Iris also intends to have full feature parity with OptiFine shaderpacks. You should be able to install Iris, download a shaderpack, and have it just work out of the box. Imagine that...

## Iris Non-Goals

At the moment, we have no intention of adding additional features to OptiFine shaderpacks. Our primary goal at IrisShaders is to reach feature parity with OptiFine, so that, at least in the area of shaders, the transition from OptiFine to Iris is seamless.

Iris will never support Forge. The devs only have a limited amount of time to dedicate towards Iris, and supporting Forge would take time away from other things that are more important. Between the fact that the lead developers of Forge are not pleasant people to work with and the fact that Forge was just never intended to support the kinds of things that Iris does, maintaining a Forge port just does not make sense. And if you want to use shaders with Minecraft Forge, there's always OptiFine...

## How can I help?

At the moment, the options for contributing are somewhat limited, and there aren't any formal systems in place. However, if you know a bit about rendering or the shader pipeline, you're free to fork the project and submit a pull request.
