> ### Q. What shaders have been tested and are working with Iris? 

#### A. The following shaders have been tested and work well:

* [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders)

* [Prismarine Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/prismarine-shader)

* [BSL Shaders](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/)

* [Continuum 1.3](https://continuum.graphics/downloads)

* [Continuum 2.0.4](https://continuum.graphics/downloads) (does not work on Mesa drivers)

* SEUS (NVIDIA or AMD GPU required, does not work on Intel Windows drivers)
   * [SEUS V11](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
   * [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
      * (Workaround: to use SEUS Renewed with mesa, you need to add the environment variable "force_glsl_extensions_warn=true", to do this you need to add "set force_glsl_extensions_warn=true" as a wrapper command (you need an appropriate launcher, like PolyMC), this solution can break other shaders)
   * [SEUS PTGI E12 / HRR 2.1](https://www.sonicether.com/seus)
       * SEUS PTGI HRR 3 is not currently supported.

* [Sildur's Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/)

* [Sildur's Vibrant Shaders](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/)

* [Skylec v4.0](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/skylec-shader)

* [Tea V1.5.3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/beyondbelief-vanilla-reborn)

* [XorDev's shaders](https://github.com/XorDev/Minecraft-Shaderpacks)

* [RedHat shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/redhat-shader-v1-chocapic13-edit)

#### The following shaders have been tested and work with some minor issues:

* [Project Luma](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/projectluma) (End doesn't render properly)
  * [Sora Shaders v1.12](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/sora-shaders) (Number edit of LUMA. Works well though)

* [Triliton V8](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/trilitons-shaders) (Lighting broken - shadow everywhere)

* [Stereo's Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/stereos-default-plus) (Broken Clouds in 1.16, No sky on 1.17)
