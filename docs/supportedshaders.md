# What shaders have been tested and are working with Iris?

## The following shaders have been tested and work well:

### BSL and derivatives

* [BSL Shaders](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders/)
* [Prismarine Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/prismarine-shader)
* [AstraLex Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/astralex-shader-bsl-edit)
* [Lux Shaders](https://techdevongithub.github.io/Lux/)

### Complementary Shaders
* [Complementary Reimagined](https://www.complementary.dev/reimagined/)
  * [rethinking-voxels](https://github.com/gri573/rethinking-voxels)
* [Complementary Shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders-v4/) (BSL derivative)

### MakeUp - Ultra Fast

Only 8.5 and above works on Iris.
* [MakeUp - Ultra Fast](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/makeup-ultra-fast-shader)

### SEUS and derivatives

NVIDIA or AMD GPU required, does not work on Mesa drivers or Intel Windows drivers.

* [SEUS V11](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
* [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
* [SEUS PTGI](https://www.sonicether.com/seus)
  * SEUS PTGI HRR 3 has major issues with entities but otherwise works: https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/issues/1446
* [Continuum 1.3](https://continuum.graphics/downloads)
  * Older versions of Continuum were approved edits of SEUS. Continuum 2.0.4, an updated version, is in a separate category since it's not a SEUS edit.
* [Beyond Belief Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/beyond-belief-shaders)
  * This is a popular edit of SEUS v11, apparently. The author doesn't actually have permission to edit SEUS and is kinda rude so take that with what you will. If all you want is "SEUS v11 but better", you probably should just install SEUS Renewed.
