# What shaders are known to not work on Iris?

There are only a few shaders known to have major issues with Iris.

- Chronos 4.x (Chronos Spectral, the newer version, works correctly)
- Continuum 2.1, RT, and any other Focal Engine shaders (will never be supported)
- SEUS PTGI HRR 3 (Works, but has problems with motion blur enabled)
