/**
 * Sorts the entity list to allow entities of the same type to be properly batched. Without sorting, entities are
 * essentially rendered in random order, which makes it harder for entity batching to work properly.
 * <p>
 * Sorting reduces the number of RenderTypes that need to be active at any given time for batching to be effective.
 * For example, instead of the batching system needing to be prepared to render a pig at any time, it can know that
 * every pig is being rendered all at once, then it can use unused space within the buffer previously used for pigs for
 * something else.
 * <p>
 * This is even more effective with vanilla's entity rendering, since it only has a single buffer for most purposes,
 * except for a configured set of batched render types.
 * <p>
 * This injection point has been carefully chosen to avoid conflicts with other mixins such as
 * <a href="https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/776f798aecb792a5881ccae8784888156207a047/src/main/java/carpet/mixins/WorldRenderer_pausedShakeMixin.java#L23"> one from Carpet:</a>
 * <p>
 * By using ModifyVariable instead of Redirect, it is more likely to be compatible with other rendering mods. We also
 * use a priority of 999 to apply before most other mixins to this method, meaning that other mods adding entities to
 * the rendering list (like Twilight Forest) are more likely to have these added entities sorted.
