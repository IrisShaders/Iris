/**
 * This Mixin implements support for the ambientOcclusionLevel value. This injection point was chosen because it's
 * called by all rendering mods (so we don't need a ton of injection points), but at the same time, it's very rarely
 * overridden or injected to (because it just dispatches to a method on BlockBehavior).
 *
 * <p>Compatibility considerations:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Vanilla: Calls the relevant method in its block / fluid renderers</li>
 *     <li>Sodium / FRAPI / FREX / etc: Calls this method in relevant renderers</li>
 *     <li>Better Foliage: Unusually, Better Foliage injects into this method, but it merely redirects the call to
 *         getShadeBrightness. By using a priority of 990, we apply before Better Foliage, allowing its redirect to
 *         succeed.</li>
 *     <li>Content mods: Most content mods override the method in BlockBehavior, which doesn't cause issues with
 *         this method. </li>
 * </ul>
