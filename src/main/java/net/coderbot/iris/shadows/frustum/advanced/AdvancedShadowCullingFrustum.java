/**
 * A Frustum implementation that derives a tightly-fitted shadow pass frustum based on the player's camera frustum and
 * an assumption that the shadow map will only be sampled for the purposes of direct shadow casting, volumetric lighting,
 * and similar effects, but notably not sun-bounce GI or similar effects.
 *
 * <p>The key idea of this algorithm is that if you are looking at the sun, something behind you cannot directly cast
 * a shadow on things visible to you. It's clear why this wouldn't work for sun-bounce GI, since with sun-bounce GI an
 * object behind you could cause light to bounce on to things visible to you.</p>
 *
 * <p>Derived from L. Spiro's clever algorithm & helpful diagrams described in a two-part blog tutorial:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href="http://lspiroengine.com/?p=153">Tutorial: Tightly Culling Shadow Casters for Directional Lights (Part 1)</a></li>
 * <li><a href="http://lspiroengine.com/?p=187">Tutorial: Tightly Culling Shadow Casters for Directional Lights (Part 2)</a></li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Notable changes include switching out some of the sub-algorithms for computing the "extruded" edge planes to ones that
 * are not sensitive to the specific internal ordering of planes and corners, in order to avoid potential bugs at the
 * cost of slightly more computations.</p>

	 * We store each plane equation as a Vector4f.
	 *
	 * <p>We can represent a plane equation of the form <code>ax + by + cz = d</code> as a 4-dimensional vector
	 * of the form <code>(a, b, c, -d)</code>. In the special case of a plane that intersects the origin, we get
	 * the 4-dimensional vector <code>(a, b, c, 0)</code>. (a, b, c) is the normal vector of the plane, and d is the
	 * distance of the plane from the origin along that normal vector.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Then, to test a given point (x, y, z) against the plane, we simply extend that point to a 4-component
	 * homogenous vector (x, y, z, 1), and then compute the dot product. Computing the dot product gives us
	 * ax + by + cz - d = 0, or, rearranged, our original plane equation of ax = by + cz = d.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>Note that, for the purposes of frustum culling, we usually aren't interested in computing whether a point
	 * lies exactly on a plane. Rather, we are interested in determining which side of the plane the point exists on
	 * - the side closer to the origin, or the side farther away from the origin. Fortunately, doing this with the
	 * dot product is still simple. If the dot product is negative, then the point lies closer to the origin than the
	 * plane, and if the dot product is positive, then the point lies further from the origin than the plane.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>In this case, if the point is closer to the origin than the plane, it is outside of the area enclosed by the
	 * plane, and if the point is farther from the origin than the plane, it is inside the area enclosed by the plane.</p>
	 *
	 * <p>So:
	 * <ul>
	 *     <li>dot(plane, point) > 0 implies the point is inside</li>
	 *     <li>dot(plane, point) < 0 implies that the point is outside</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
