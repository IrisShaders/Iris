/**
 * Tweaks the far plane of the projection matrix to match OptiFine.
 *
 * As it turns out, OptiFine significantly reduces the far plane distance compared to vanilla. This is likely because
 * vanilla chooses a far plane that is four times the render distance in blocks, which is a bit overkill. Instead,
 * OptiFine makes the far plane only 1024 blocks above the render distance in blocks (two times the render distance in 1.16 and lower), and (in 1.16) to compensate, adds a minimum distance
 * for the far plane to make it not appear too closely to the player.
 *
 * On 1.16 and lower, OptiFine also modifies the distance of the far plane based on the fog setting.
 *
 * So why is this needed? As it turns out, shaderpacks actually rely on this behavior to work properly. Most notably,
 * the water reflection code in Sildur's Vibrant Shaders will often create impossible reflections with the default far
 * plane, where things that are close to the player will be reflected in water that is very far away.
 *
 * A possible reason for this is that the value of the {@code far} uniform does not actually match the far plane
 * distance, so shaderpacks one way or another have come to just bodge things to work around the issue, and in the
 * process become subtly reliant on OptiFine implementation details.
 *
 * Fun.
